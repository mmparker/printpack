# Overview
printpack is a command-line utility for printing TBESC participant packets
in order and grouped in a way to take advantage of auto-stapling printers. You
should be able to point printpack to a PDF of combined participant forms (that
is, the ones generated by DMS) and print packets that complete except for
the TSPOT requisition and any labels you need.

# Requirements
Unfortunately, wrangling PDFs is pretty hard to do and requires that you have
all of these programs installed on your computer *and* on your system path:
 - Python 2.7 (www.python.org)
 - pdftk (www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/)
 - Ghostscript (www.ghostscript.com)
 - gsprint (pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/gsprint.htm)

It's quite possibly that your institution won't let you install some of these
programs or won't let you modify your system path. I can't provide that kind
of support to everyone, so please check with your local IT support if you
have questions or problems with this stuff.

# What It Does
When you run printpack (at the command line, type 'python printpack.py'),
it will:
 - Create a 'printed' directory in your current working directory, 
   if one doesn't already exist - this is where it stashes PDFs that have been
   printed
 - Ask you where to find the pre-enrollment form PDF, the adult consent form
   PDF, and the parental permission form PDF (just once - it'll remember
   thereafter)
 - Ask you where the DMS-generated PDF of forms is
 - Ask you whether the forms are adult or pediatric
 - Ask you how many forms are in the packet

Once you've given it this information, printpack will break down and reassemble
the DMS PDF into the correct order (or at least, the order we prefer in Denver),
then start printing the forms. This can take a LONG TIME, so I'd suggest
loading your printer with paper and firing it off over lunch.

If you run printpack in its own directory, it will remember where your
pre-enrollment, consent, and permission forms are, so you'll only have to hunt
for them once, as well as putting together an archive of PDF forms that have
been printed out previously.
